## File sharding

Collection of several partitioning and sharding distribution algorithms used to determine the nodes on which a chunk
(shard) of a file and its replicas should be placed.  
**It doesn't handle the actual data transfer, but only the logical distribution of the shards.**

You can see more details [File Sharding](https://github.com/radumarias/rfs/wiki/File-sharding).
